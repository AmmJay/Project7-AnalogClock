for hour hand:
12 hrs - 360 degrees
1 hr - 30 degrees
but cuz of minute hand: 60 mins - 30 degrees
so for 1 minute hour hand moves by 0.5 degrees
therefore for h hrs and m mins, hour hand from 12 will move by (h*30)+(m*0.5) degrees

for minute hand:
60mins - 360 degrees
so m mins - 6m degrees

for seconds hand : 
60 sec - 360 degrees
so s sec - 6s degrees
